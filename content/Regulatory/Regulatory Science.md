# What is Regulatory Science

Regulatory Science is the science of developing new tools, standards, and approaches to assess the safety, efficacy, quality, and performance of all regulated products.

The goal of regulatory science is to ensure that regulatory decisions are based on the best available scientific evidence and are made in a transparent and objective manner. Regulatory science encompasses a wide range of scientific disciplines, including biology, chemistry, public health, pharmacology, toxicology, and more.
