# Ideation

The first step of the journey is to generate solutions, regardless of whether they are good or bad.

## Question 1: Does this idea meet an unmet market need?

This is the first question investors will want to know. Even the most promising technology is only as good as the benefits it can provide for

## Question 2: Have this been attempted in the past? What happened?

Early on, it's good to get as many good advices as yoyu can. And there's plenty of wisdom from history. Undestanding the competition and what have been tried in the past is an important step in any good research.

## Question 3: What is something I know that other people don't?

Your first idea may not be the best idea, it is important to not be held hostage by your original idea.

Some of the best ideas came from past failures.

## Question 4: What is the minimum viable product I can use to test out this proof of concept?

By creating a prototype, the entrepreur can quickly test and iterate on the idea based on actual user feedback. This is one of the core tenets of design thinking. It does not need to look good or even work, the goal is to give potential customer a rough idea of what the product is like and how it functions. The magic sauce is in the feedback cycle.
