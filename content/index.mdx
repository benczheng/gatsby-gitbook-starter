title: "Welcome to inventHealthcare"

Do you have an idea that has been ricocheting in the back of your head? You are at your computer, the keyboard sits underneath your hands, as you fire off letters frantically as your mind crawls sluggishly in a persistent haze of fog.

Most people dream about doing something big in their lives. Perhaps you are a researcher dreaming of bringing to market a new product, restructuring the healthcare delivery, making patients’ lives better around the world. Maybe you’re a doctor, an aspiring administrator dreaming of doing something grand, or perhaps you are an intrapreneur who is looking to work within organizations to help transform healthcare.

No matter what you're dreaming about, getting started and taking that first step is the most difficult part. Dreaming is easy, when you dream the endings are always perfect. Once you decide to take that first step, when you move from dreamer to doer, things get a lot more complicated (This is where we try to help).

If you're looking to do something big in the healthcare this is not going to happen on its own, you'll need a plan and friends along the way!

As the great Irish poet and Senator William Butler Yeats [wrote](https://poets.org/poem/aedh-wishes-cloths-heaven), "Thread softly because you thread on my dreams."
