# General

[Addgene](https://www.addgene.org/kits/): Website to browse a full list of various kits and tools.

# SynBio Toolkits

[BioBricks](https://biobricks.org/) onef of the first communal synbio platform with many basic parts

[MoClo-YTK / PTK](https://moclo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kits/ytk/index.html): well-documented and well-characterized yeast toolkit for modular and multi-part assembly and PTK for protein secretion.

[YeastFab](https://new.cailab.org/yeastfab-2/) library of standardised and well-characterised biological parts (promoters, open-reading frames and terminators) for the Saccharomyces cerevisiae

[GoldenBraid](https://gbcloning.upv.es/) an online platform with a number of cross-hierarchical assembly, including one for yeast. It has inspired other modular system like for plants and [FungalBraid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1087184518300690).

[CRISPR Cas9-based pCut](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27899650/) an efficient CRISPR-based  genomic integration system

[EasyClone Yeast ToolKit](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4282123/): CRISPR-based genomic integration

[EasyCloneYAL](https://ezclone.com/): genomic integration

[Yeast Prototrophy Kit](https://www.addgene.org/kits/prototrophy/): Auxotrophic markers

[Yeast Secrete and Detect](<https://www.addgene.org/kits/marillonnet-yeast-secrete-detect/#:~:text=(Kit%20%23%201000000166%20)&text=This%20kit%20contains%20a%20collection,Saccharomyces%20cerevisiae%20and%20Pichia%20pastoris.>): improved for yeast protein secretion
