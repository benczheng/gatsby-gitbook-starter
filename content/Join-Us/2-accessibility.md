inventHealthcare recognizes that accessibility is an important consideration in our design of websites and digital content. The goal is to design element that is accessible to everyone, including individuals with disabilities. This helps to promote equal access to information and services to the people we care about, and helps to create a more inclusive and accessible online community.

If you’ve encountered a problem navigating our website, accessibility or not, please let us know! The best way to do this is sending me an email on the Contact Us page.
