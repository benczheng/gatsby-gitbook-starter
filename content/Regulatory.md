The US Food and Drug Administration(FDA) is the regulatory agency with vast jurisdiction. It is a scientific institution rooted in its missions of protecting public health and promoting innovation. For entrepreneurs, approaching the FDA can be daunting. This knowledge article provides an overview of the regulatory process from ideation of an innovative idea to the U.S. market. Obtaining regulatory approval is more than just a hurdle to overcome, the FDA is a valued partner in the innovation process. At this time, scope of the regulatory overview will focus on medical devices.

## Step 1 Ideation
### Should My Product be Regulated?

Entrepreneurs often ask whether their product is regulated by the FDA. For a range of consumer products health or wellness products, it is possible to develop go-to market strategy without the need to obtain pre-market authorization from the FDA. Entrepreneurs working on wellness and mobile health (mHealth) technology startups should explore FDA’s guidance on the matter. Entrepreneurs are encouraged to think critically on the marketing claims of your products to determine whether or not a regulatory approval is preferred.

If the decision is made to not pursue regulation, the marketing must be carefully reviewed to ensure that it does make health claims. If decision is made to pursue regulation, innovators can file a 513(g) petition to obtain a formal determination on whether the product classify as a medical device.

## Step 2
### Determine Your Product Classification

It is imperative for the entrepreneur to determine what is the product going to be classified in the United States. Regulatory definition of product classifications may be different among different countries. In the United States, products regulated under by the FDA are either drugs, biologics, medical devices, or a combination products. The entrepreneur will need to make an assessment to determine the final form of their product and be regulated under the appropriate center. The FDA is divided into multiple centers:
- **Food**: Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFAN)
- **Medical Devices**: Center for Devices & Radiological Health (CDRH)
- **Drugs**: Center for Drug Evaluation & Research (CDER)
- **Biologics**: Center for Biologics Evaluation & Research (CBER)
- **Vet Medicine**: Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVN)
- **Toxicology**: National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR)

The FDA defines a medical device as:

>"An instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including a component part, or accessory which is:
>1.	recognized in the official National Formulary, or the United States Pharmacopoeia, or any supplement to them,
>2.	intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or other animals, or
>3.	intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals, and which does not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or other animals and which does not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical action

In general, a product is a medical device if it diagnose, cure, mitigate or prevent a disease or condition and does not achieve its effects through chemical action (drugs) or metabolic change (biologics).  If you have a complex products with both a drug and device components, for example drug-eluting stents, you may have a combination product.  These combination products are coordinated by FDA Office for Combination Products (OCP).

## Step 3 Discovery
### Device Classification

Once the entrepreneur has done the due diligence and determine that their product will be consider a medical device, the product will be regulated by Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH). CDRH utilizes a 3 class risk-based approach to balance benefits and risks.  Class I devices present minimal potential harm to the person and simple design, for which the risk is so low that they are often exempt from regulatory clearance and subject to a minimum list of regulatory requirements (general control). Class II devices are often non-invasion but more complicated in design, so the FDA expects innovators to demonstrate they the products will perform as expected. Class II devices are generally cleared using the 510(k) process, and subject to more regulatory oversights (general control and special control). Class III devices are high-risk devices that are typically implantable, therapeutic, or life-sustaining devices. Usually class III devices must obtain pre-market authorization and have additional regulatory oversight.

|Class| Description |Common Pathway|Example|Control|
|---|---|---|---|---|:-:|
| I  |presents minimal potential harm and are simple in design.|exempt; some 510(k)|bandages, gloves, surgical tools|General Control|   |
| II  |often non-invasive, but tend to be more complicated in design.|510(k)|infusion pumps, x-ray equipment, sutures|General Control, Special Control|
| III  |high-risk devices that are typically implantable, therapeutic, or life sustaining device.|PMA|pacemakers, replacement heart valve, cerebellar stimulators|General Control and Pre-Market Approval (PMA)|


While the FDA has the ultimate decision on the product’s device classification, the innovators have quick significant latitude to guide the decision. Depending on the classification, the product evaluation is bucketed to different Branches, who are experts in those products. Reviewers, who often are working on more than a dozen applications at a time, are among the unsung heroes of the agency.
