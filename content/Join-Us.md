## Who are We?

We are builders, tackling health care's biggest problems is our number one priority.  The myth of the triumphant individual is deeply ingrained in the pysche. And yet we all know th at collaboration and community grow more important every day. It is this collective energy that will transform our healthcare challenges. Great ideas come from all over our community!

## Mission

There are no more important mission than to improve human health and global quality of life. We must change our mindset from being technology-centric to people-centric. Instead of starting with the technology, we must start with the unmet need. Let us focus on human capabilities, and use the technology to expand our abilities. We must return to the core essence of human-centered design: solve the fundamental problems in people’s lives.

We offers a wide range of resources and information to help innovators navigate the FDA regulatory landscape, insurance reimbursement environment, and sales & marketing strategies. All of the knowledge articles and action items listed below are easy to use.

## Membership

Most people dream about doing something big in their lives. Perhaps you are a researcher dreaming of bringing to market a new product, restructuring the healthcare delivery, making patients’ lives better around the world. Maybe you’re a doctor, an aspiring administrator dreaming of doing something grand, or perhaps you are an intrapreneur who is looking to work within organizations to help transform healthcare.

No matter what you're dreaming about, getting started and taking that first step is the most difficult part. Dreaming is easy, when you dream the endings are always perfect. Once you decide to take that first step, when you move from dreamer to doer, things get a lot more complicated.

If you're looking to do something big in the healthcare this is not going to happen on its own, you'll need a plan and friends along the way!
